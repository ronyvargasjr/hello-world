# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I was born in Guatemala. My family and I moved to the United States when I was less than a year old. Since my early years, I have wanted to be an engineer. What I love about engineering is using creativity to create and problem-solve. Through many years of trial and error, I went from a Mechanical Engineer to a graduate of Biochemistry. Then, in August of 2021, I began the process of a career change and self-teaching myself to become a software engineer. I joined a Quality Assurance Bootcamp to learn the fundamentals of the Software Development Life Cycle and the Software Testing Life Cycle. I followed that by studying Python through Google's IT Automation with Python course. Now, I am seeking a place that will give me the chance to prove my analytical skills and coding knowledge.
